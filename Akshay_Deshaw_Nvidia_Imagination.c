DE shaw:
1. Do you know about OOP concepts? ( Write C++ code for each)
2. How will you copy a structure given pointers to the source and destination?
3. You are given pointer to any random node in a linked list. How will you insert a node before the given node?
4. You have 7 gold cubes connected in a line by string. you have a slave coming to you every day for work. As a salary you need to pay him a gold cube everyday for his work. you are allowed to cut only 2 times. How will you manage this situation ?
5. Some DBMS queries .( i couldn't write )

Nvidia :
1. What is priority inversion problem?
2. You have a process inside a critical section and an interrupt occurs and want to access the same section. What will you do ? ( The answer to this question lies in the 1st question!!! Alas, I figured it out only after the interview!!)
3. Write a C code to find if the given machine is little endian of big endian.
4. 2 stations A and B are 100 KM apart. A train starts from station A at 60 KM/hr towards B. A train (40KM /hr) and a helicopter (100KM /hr) start at station B  towards A. Helicopter travells till the head of train coming from to opposite direction and then returns and travels till the head of the other train. It does this till both the trains meet somewhere in the middle. What distance does the helicopter travel?
5. Give an algorithm to find the area of an n sided irregular polygon.
6. You have a machine with 3 buttons, labelled "tea" , "coffee" and "random". Random button will give either tea of coffee. But there is a problem:  All the buttons are wrongly connected internally. You need to press one button and identify which button is connected where. How will you do it?
7. There are 4 people two of them wearing black caps and 2 wearing red caps. One of them is inside a room where others can't see him. Remaining 3 are standing on stairs one after another facing in one direction only. Now, one of them has to tell his own cap's color. Is it possible? How ?
8. Write a function to print a matrix . user can pass either staically allocated or  dynamically allocated matrix.
9. Describe all the processes that happen when you play a video online. (Expected : How video comes from network to storage to ram to display adapter to screen... :D )

Imagination :
1. Write a assembly code for following problem:
    You have 2 ports where you periodically receive ascii characters. At any instant if the characters occured on both the ports form an anagram then output 1 on a particular port.
2. You have coins in denomination of 1 10 and 12. You need to pay 100, write an algorithm to find the minimum no of coins to pay the said amount.
3. Write a c code to find the minimum common parent of the 2 given nodes of a binary search tree.
4.What is a volatile vairable? What is difference between short , int , long and 'long long' ? What role do they play in portability of the c code?
5. Write a c code to find the nearest smaller and nearest larger binary no for the given binary no such that the nos have the same no of 1's in them.
6. What is a reentrant code ?
7.What is the need of segmentation? Isn't paging sufficient to do the work of what segmentation does? ( Mostly I found it difficult to answer these general type of questions)
8. Do you have any idea about greedy approach of problem solving?
9. There's a casino with 4 gates. You need to visit each gate. While visiting each gate you need to pay Rs. 5 as visiting fee. Once you are in the casino your money doubles. How much money you take while leaving your house, so that when you come back home you have no money left?
10. Why rolling friction is less than static friction ?( Interviewer was crazy :P)
11. Why does light get split when passed from prism? (When i started explaining he contradicted me using the fact: Light doesn't get split using a glass slab)

12. In following c code <type> is one of {int , char, float, long , short }
<type> f(<type> a)
{
    return a+1;
}
For what value of <type> the c code takes least CPU cycles ??

13.
while(i =0 ; i < 200; i++)
{
    f();
}
while(i =0 ; i < 200; i++)
{
    g();
}
How do you optimise this c code?


14. What is the op?
char c;
for (c =0 ; c < 200; c++)
    printf("%d", c);
   
15. Optimise the code :

main()
{
int i;
for (i =0 ; i < 200 ; i++)
    f();   
}
void f()
{
    // 1 to 2 statements
    ....
}
16. Write a c code for given mealey machine: (a diagram for the machine was given , I dont remember :P ). The question was quite simple don't worry.
17. Write a c code to delete a node from a linked list.
