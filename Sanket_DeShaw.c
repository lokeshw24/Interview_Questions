    Tell me about yourself. ( Name, Hobbies [Coding, badminton, Blog])
    Favourite subjects ( OS, Sys Programming, Programming related anything)
    Lets start with OS. What all things happen when user runs command ls  (strace, sys calls)
    What is a system call?
    What is a software interrupt? What is a hardware interrupt?
    When I press Ctrl + C is it a h/w interrupt?
    How does OS knows that s/w interrupt has occurred?
    What is thrashing?
    What is throughput, turn-around time, response time and waiting time?
    How to check the throughput of the system?
    Write a program to implement LRU Cache.
    What is a compiler?
    C compiler is written in c and compiled using c compiler only. How's that possible?
    static linking , static loading, dynamic linking, dynamic loading
    WAP which uses extern keyword. In what cases this program would fail? i.e. in what cases extern keyword cannot be used? Can we do scanf on it? How does extern variables get linked?
    If I compile 2 prgms like    cc a.c b.c    instead of    cc b.c a.c     would that make any difference? What?
    What is hashing, encoding and encryption?
    What is normalization? Take one small example and explain.
    If you have very big database, how would you search data efficiently into the database?
    What is indexing? How would you use it?
    If you have been given database containing 6 Billion rows, how would you sort all the rows in the database? Remember that you cannot have complete database in the RAM at a time.
    What is a unique key? Can any unique key contain >1 columns?
    Is a primary key a unique key?
    Write a program to convert a binary search tree into a sorted doubly linklist.
    What is virtual in C++?
    What is the difference between abstract class and interface? If I make all the methods in abstract as a function declaration would it be exactly same as the interface? What difference would be there then?
    Which protocol i.e. TCP or UDP is used for wireless communication?
    What is the difference between Switch and Router?
    What is a DHCP protocol? How does it work practically? What are its advantages?
    What is the concept of subnetworking?
    And a lot more.. But now I dont remember everything.. Basically the questions were based on OS, Sys Pro, C, C++, Java, CN and DBMS.

/****************************************/

    Do you take part in C competitions? ( :D :D I was super happy with this question.. :D What a great start of the interview.) 
    What did you do after going home yesterday?
    What is malloc? Where does memory for malloc get allocated?
    If I have declared char *p = (char *)malloc(10); P goes into which memory area, heap or stack?
    How will you cause stack overflow? Write a program for that.
    How will you design an application which would restrict stack overflow, i.e. it should detect if stack is full and accordingly should handle the program.
    What is a signal?
    In a client-server architecture, how does server serve many clients at a time?
    What is threading? If 2 threads are trying to access same resource, how will you restrict it?
    What is lock? How is it implemented in the system?
    How will you apply the lock if you have say 3 resources of same type and you want a process to wait only if all 3 resources are locked, then how will you apply the lock?
    What is semaphore?
    We apply locks on the threads of the program, but how does locking take place between processes? Who does it?
    Write a program to count the addition of nodes from all the columns of the binary tree. Where a column will have all the nodes lying in the same vertical line.
    Are you comfortable with C++ And Java. What is a friend function in C++?
    What is a copy constructor in c++?
    What is difference between reference variable and pointer variable?
    Can we create a reference variable in java? If so, how? As there are no pointers in java, how such variable points to something?
    What is an interface and abstract class?
    If I just declare the methods inside abstract class without any definition, would the class be exactly same as an interface?
    How would you avoid linear search on a huge database?
    What is indexing? How would you implement it.? Would it be inside SQL software or you will have to implement it on your own.
    Again there were some more questions but now am unable to recall all of them.
